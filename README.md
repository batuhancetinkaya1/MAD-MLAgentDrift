# MAD ML AGENT DRIFT

## Introduction
MAD ML AGENT DRIFT is a Unity-based project utilizing ML-Agents to train an AI agent to drive a car in a 2D environment. The project focuses on creating a drift-capable physics system while optimizing the agent's performance on three different tracks:
- **Track 1:** Training environment.
- **Track 2:** Intermediate test environment.
- **Track 3:** Final evaluation track.

## Features
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Training an agent to complete tracks in the shortest time possible.
- **Physics System:** Custom drift physics for realistic and challenging driving mechanics.
- **Environment Variety:** Tracks with walls and boundaries to challenge the agent's navigation.

## Installation
1. Install Unity (2023.x or later) and the ML-Agents package.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/MAD_ML_AGENT_DRIFT.git
