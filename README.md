\section*{Introduction}
MAD ML AGENT DRIFT is a Unity-based project utilizing ML-Agents to train an AI agent to drive a car in a 2D environment. The project focuses on creating a drift-capable physics system while optimizing the agent's performance on three different tracks: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Track 1: Training environment.
    \item Track 2: Intermediate test environment.
    \item Track 3: Final evaluation track.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Features}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reinforcement Learning:} Training an agent to complete tracks in the shortest time possible.
    \item \textbf{Physics System:} Custom drift physics for realistic and challenging driving mechanics.
    \item \textbf{Environment Variety:} Tracks with walls and boundaries to challenge the agent's navigation.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Installation}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Install Unity (2023.x or later) and ML-Agents package.
    \item Clone this repository:
    \begin{verbatim}
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/MAD_ML_AGENT_DRIFT.git
    \end{verbatim}
    \item Open the project in Unity Hub.
    \item Ensure Python 3.x is installed and install required Python libraries:
    \begin{verbatim}
    pip install mlagents
    \end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Usage}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Open Unity and load the desired scene (e.g., Track 1).
    \item Start training by running the ML-Agent training script:
    \begin{verbatim}
    mlagents-learn config.yaml --run-id=MAD_run
    \end{verbatim}
    \item Observe the training process and adjust hyperparameters as needed.
    \item Use Track 3 for final evaluation and test the agent's performance.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Enhance the AI's decision-making with advanced reward functions.
    \item Expand to 3D environments with more complex track designs.
    \item Implement multiplayer mode for AI vs AI and player vs AI competitions.
\end{itemize}
