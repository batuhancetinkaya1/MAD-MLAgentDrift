# MAD(MLAgentDrift
 MAD is a 2D simulation project where an ML Agent learns to drive and drift on racetracks. Using Unity ML-Agents, the project trains an autonomous car to optimize lap times with raycasting-based environmental awareness. Designed as a learning experience to explore machine learning concepts.
